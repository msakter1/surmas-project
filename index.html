            <p>This is a photo I took while visiting Petite France in South Korea. The area was absolutely stunning, with breathtaking mountain views that left me in awe.</p>

            <p>If I ever go back, I’d definitely avoid visiting in July. (If you know, you know!) Instead, I think April or May would be the perfect time to experience this place. The weather is much more pleasant, and South Korea, in general, is magical during spring.</p>

            <h2>Hi there!</h2>
            <p>I’m a 21-year-old junior studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. 
                Aside from coding, I’m passionate about reading, drawing, watching movies, and crocheting.</p>
            
            <p>Recently, I read <em>The Boyfriend</em> by Freida McFadden. For the first two-thirds of the book, I thought it was a quick and easy read—nothing special in terms of characters or plot. 
            But then the ending hit like a storm with a massive twist I <strong>did not</strong> see coming. It completely changed how I felt about the book, leaving me with so many questions. 
            I went looking for others who’d read it, but since it was such a new release, there wasn’t much discussion online. So, I was stuck with all these thoughts and no place to put them. </p>

            <p>That’s where the idea for this website came from. I’m already taking a web development class and practicing my coding skills, so why not create something personal? 
            I’m also a pretty opinionated person—I always have strong takes on the books I read and the movies I watch. This site gives me a place to share those thoughts. </p>

            <p>Beyond books and movies, I also wanted to reflect on my creative projects, like my drawings and crochet work. The site is kind of a simpler version of the book and movie lists I’ve been keeping on Notion, so a lot of the inspiration comes from there. </p>
